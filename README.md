# turtle
## My attempt at a basic turtle crossing the road game in Python

### How to setup
Just Clone the repository and play the main.py file and that's it. No extra modules or anything

### How to play
I'll let you work that out :) Hint: Don't get squashed

### How to win
If you're playing this game, you're already a winner :) Try to get to level 10

### How does it work
I used the Turtle module for Python. There are a few classes for the cars and some basic logic
to make them random. The game loops and updates and when it does this, it redraws the cars and 
Turtle in a new position. I just realised something. I should have called the game frog!!!
